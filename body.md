## Body tightness

My body tends to get very tight. This expresses itself all throughout my body. Muscles become tender,And I beat begin to experience pain in my back, feet, hips, and neck.

It's very possible that a major contributor to this is **stress** (in addition to lack of exercise). Therefore it is important to manage my stress and change my mindset to reduce stressful triggers.

Triggers:

- Defensiveness caused by my ego when I disagree with someone on a technical issue For someone challenges my technical opinion.
- Lots of email
- Lots of unfinished tasks, especially ones that are procrastinated on

What to do:

- Learn to recognize and stop yourself when you have a stress response. Use SODA
- Recall meditation visualization multiple times throughout the day for 30 seconds each
- Deep breaths
- TODO: Read and research this topic more to learn how to reduce the negative aspects of my ego. Then document my learnings here.
- TODO: Ask therapist for resources
