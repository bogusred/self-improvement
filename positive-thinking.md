Metacognition (thinking what you're thinking about)
- "When **negative thoughts** arise, I think about my thoughts and **reframe** those that don't serve me."

Productivity
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- I start things even if I may *fear not doing it perfectly*. I will **not let perfectionism freeze me** from making progress.
- When adding tasks I ask myself if it will take more than 20 minutes. If so, I will break it down and instead add a smaller task to my to-do list.

Other themes useful to create affirmations around:
- Confidence
- Positive thinking
- Gratitude

# Celebrate success

It is important for happiness and building confidence and momentum to acknowledge and celebrate completing things.

- highlight the things in your journal you're proud to have accomplished or completed, even the small/simple tasks, especially if they took a long time to get done or required a lot of effort
- share your accomplishments with others
- treat yourself to a reward
- for larger accomplishments, celebrate with a nice dinner out with others
- in your BuJo you can do a weekly summary of your successes. This is a chance to reflect on a regular basis.

# Visualization

Spend 5-10 minutes a day visualizing yourself achieving your goals. You'll be more likely to get there. You can create a mood board or just imagine it in your head. Source: [Miracle Morning](http://a.co/aHOg0ga).
