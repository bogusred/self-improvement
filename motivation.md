- Watch a motivational video like this [To the glory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmWfXKJbn9g).
- Get an accountability partner. Have regular checkins to make sure you're each reaching your goals. You can also join a monthly/weekly meet up which gives you a deadline to get your work done by.
- Do the work you're most excited about and delegate the rest if possible.

# Overwhelm
If you're having trouble getting moving on something, it could be because you feel overwhelmed. Try to:

- break tasks down into 10 minute parts
- limit the view of your task list so you only see a few things (Bujo is also good for this)
- keep calm and pomodoro. You can modify to 10 minutes instead of 25 if 25 feels too hard.
- change of scenery
- caffiene
- music
- delegate
