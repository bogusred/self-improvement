## Interacting with anyone

First 90 seconds interaction with a person is key to your likeability

- Talk about what others want and show them how to get it.
- Be the first to smile, sincerely
- Remember and use peoples names. People like the sound of their name.
- Body language
  - position your body toward them. Heart aimed at other person
  - direct eye contact
  - open body language
- Mimic their demeanor and communication style to make them feel more comfortable
  - (slow/fast), (quiet/loud), (reserved/outgoing)
  - are they a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic/emotional learner? Mimic their style.
    - visual eye pattern: up to left/right
    - auditory eye pattern: left/right (toward ears)
    - kinesthetic: down left/right
- Use conversation starters
  - Use questions that aren't yes/no questions
- Encourage others to talk about themselves

## Interacting with customers

- See things from your customers perspective
- Begin communications with showing your customers how much you value and appreciate them.

### Difficult people

- For those not being respectful toward other community members
  - Where possible, try to have this conversation over video or voice
  - Remind them of the community guidelines
  - it's ok to disagree
  - be respectful toward others, no personal attacks
- Sometimes people get angry, don't believe you, or you are unsuccessful in convincing them of something
  - I have a tendancy to not let things go and want to put more energy into resolution. I keep going back and ruminating, even imagining having a conversation with the other person trying to resolve it. This is caused by the ADHD trait of not liking uncertainty. But this is ultimately unproductive.
  - To resolve this, I must remember:
    - I am not responsible for other people's feelings
    - It's best not to expell energy on them as this will take away from more important things.
