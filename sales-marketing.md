# Sales/Marketing

> I know of no other skills to be more important than selling and marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for most people, primarily due to their fear of rejection.

## Newsletter

The most important law in money:
> "Give, and you shall receive."

> "The money is in the list."

Ask users to sign up for your mailing list and send them useful content, such as a monthly newsletter.

- Why you should have a newsletter
  - re-engages users.
  - builds positive relationship with your users. They get to know you and like you. If they like you, they're more likely to trust you and want to buy your products.
- Tools
  - Mailchimp or Convertkit
- Content
  - Begin by expressing how much you value your readers and how you can help them in some way (per How to win friends and influence people)
  - Be useful. Be a friend. Must provide value to the user. Can't just be sales pitches or you'll lose subscribers. Be informative or inspire action.
  - Can reuse your existing content from social media (if it's useful). E.g. tutorials, articles, etc.
  - Community:
    - Show you value your members by highlighting their contributions. Inform them that it will go out in the next newsletter.
- Measure
  - Check metrics and which links are clicked most to help inform future content decisions
  - 10-20% is a great open rate.


## Use a mailing list to measure product validation

You can use a mailing list as a means of validating your product idea. Create a landing page explaining your product before you've even built it and ask people to sign up so they'll be notified when the product is ready. This is a way to confirm if the product is worth building because you had people sign up for it.

## Social Media

  - Only 2% of your audience will see a given post on Facebook/Twitter/etc. Might as well reuse the existing content you have and repost it.
  - Saves time by allowing you to add content in bulk and schedule it to automatically post and re-post.
