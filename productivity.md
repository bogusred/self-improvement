# Productivity
## Time management

- Pomodoro technique
- Time blocking
  - Set a weekly reminder to plan your week and add tasks to your calendar.
  - Look at the time available first. Grab tasks from your sprint or todo list and add a block for each task on a calendar. Do this for the entire week.
  - Ensure tasks are balanced. Use colors for each type of task. E.g. green for traction/marketing, blue for product development, yellow for research. This helps you see at a high level if you've got good balance.
  - This is important. **Be ok with your plans changing**. Don't let the commitment prevent you from using the time blocking technique.
- Defend your calendar and time.
  - "Make Time" Block off 2-4 hour chunks on your calendar where people can't schedule meetings with you. Larger chunks of time allow for better productivity because task switching is expensive
  - Add a task at the beginning of your week to review your calendar. Reschedule or decline meetings if they interrupt a large time block. Group meetings together where possible.
- For every meeting you are invited to, ask for an agenda. If one isn't provided, don't go.
- Have a team wide no meeting day.

## Stuck/Overwhelm

As an ADHDer I frequently and easily get overwhelmed which causes me to freeze, which impedes my progress. Also sometimes I have a task that I procrastinate on. For whatever reason there is a barrier stopping me from getting it done.

Steps to avoid or stop overwhelm:

- Often there is a fear you will forget to do something. Put tasks you can't do now in your bujo future log or project backlog so they aren't floating in your head. Try to keep all related items in the same backlog.
- Break things down into separate tasks.
  - each task should not take more than 20 minutes to complete. If it exceeds that amount, break it down further
- Talk to spouse or friend to help you
- Be more realistic with goals
  - See **Time Blocking** above. Helps you be more realistic about what you can get done in a day because you have to assign estimates to things and prevents you from assigning too many things to a day.


### Identify barriers

A lot of this I learned from my coaching sessions with [Brett Thornhill](http://embraceyouradhd.ca/). Ask yourself the following and write it down:

- What barriers, fears, or stories am I telling myself that's preventing myself from doing this?
- What's the worst that could happen?
- Is there any damage beyond repair if I do this thing?
- Do a cost, benefit analysis if there are costs (not just monetary, think of time as well) or negative consequences involved
- Do you have something personal holding you back?
- What are your reasons for doing this task?
- Can I delegate this task?

After doing that, it will become clearer how to get past the barriers.


## Mindset changes

You may have a project that you're waiting for a large block of time to do. And that large time block will never come and you never get it done. Throw away the mindset that you need a large block of time to do it. Instead break it down into smaller parts and only think about that small task in your head. A small bit of progress is better than no progress. Add that smaller task to your bujo or calendar.

Perfectionism stops you from starting tasks. You might have a mindset that you expect the results to not meet your expectations so why try. Put that mindset aside and replace it with something positive such as "even if the result doesn't meet my expectations, I will have gotten more experience and will be getting better as an artist."

## Other

- At the end of your day, plan the next day's tasks. Star the 2-3 most important items. This helps you jump start your productivity in the morning.
- Leave something easy unfinished at end of day so that the next day you start with something easy and get started quicker
- Listen to motivational music
- Don't keep email tab open all day. Just check it at specific intervals during day.
- Don't start your day by reading emails. This means you'll end up getting other people's work done rather than your own.
