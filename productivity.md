# Time management

- Pomodoro technique
- Time blocking
- "Make Time" Block off 2-4 hour chunks on your calendar where people can't schedule meetings with you. Larger chunks of time allow for better productivity because task switching is expensive
- For every meeting you are invited to, ask for an agenda. If one isn't provided, don't go.
- Have a team wide no meeting day.

# Other

- At the end of your day, plan the next day's tasks. Star the 2-3 most important items. This helps you jump start your productivity in the morning.
- Leave something easy unfinished at end of day so that the next day you start with something easy and get started quicker
- Listen to motivational music
- Don't keep email tab open all day. Just check it at specific intervals during day.
- Don't start your day by reading emails. This means you'll end up getting other people's work done rather than your own.
