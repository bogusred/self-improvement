# Time management

- Pomodoro technique
- Time blocking
  - Be ok with your plans changing. Don't let the commitment prevent you from using the time blocking technique.
  - Use colors, make it look nice
- "Make Time" Block off 2-4 hour chunks on your calendar where people can't schedule meetings with you. Larger chunks of time allow for better productivity because task switching is expensive
- For every meeting you are invited to, ask for an agenda. If one isn't provided, don't go.
- Have a team wide no meeting day.


# Mindset changes

You may have a project that you're waiting for a large block of time to do. And that large time block will never come and you never get it done. Throw away the mindset that you need a large block of time to do it. Instead break it down into smaller parts and only think about that small task in your head. A small bit of progress is better than no progress. Add that smaller task to your bujo or calendar.

Perfectionism stops you from starting tasks. You might have a mindset that you expect the results to not meet your expectations so why try. Put that mindset aside and replace it with something positive such as "even if the result doesn't meet my expectations, I will have gotten more experience and will be getting better as an artist."

# Other

- At the end of your day, plan the next day's tasks. Star the 2-3 most important items. This helps you jump start your productivity in the morning.
- Leave something easy unfinished at end of day so that the next day you start with something easy and get started quicker
- Listen to motivational music
- Don't keep email tab open all day. Just check it at specific intervals during day.
- Don't start your day by reading emails. This means you'll end up getting other people's work done rather than your own.
